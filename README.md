---

## Aim
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques—such as query decomposition, decision-making, answer engineering, fact-checking, tail generation, menu actions, and semantic filtering—can be used to generate reports, case studies, articles, and creative stories using AI models like ChatGPT.  
The goal is to observe how different prompt structures influence the quality, coherence, and accuracy of the generated content.

---

## Procedure

### **1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns**
Before generating content, understand the following prompting techniques:

- **Query Decomposition**  
  Breaking down complex tasks into smaller parts.

- **Decision-Making Prompts**  
  Allowing the AI to choose between options to guide direction.

- **Answer Engineering**  
  Structuring the response using headings, bullet points, metrics, etc.

- **Fact-Check List**  
  Ensuring accuracy for reports or case studies.

- **Tail Generation**  
  Extending stories or analyses logically.

- **Menu Actions**  
  Providing a list of actions for the model to select.

- **Semantic Filtering**  
  Controlling tone, style, creativity, and complexity.

### **2. Choosing the Content Type**
For this experiment, two scenarios are selected:

✔ **Scenario A: Business Report on Market Trends**  
✔ **Scenario B: Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story**

# **SCENARIO B — CREATIVE WRITING: SCI-FI SHORT STORY**
# ---------------------------------------------------------

## **First Draft (Basic Prompt)**

### **Prompt V1**
Write a sci-fi short story.

### **Output V1**
In the year 2300, humans discovered a portal to another galaxy. Explorers entered it and found new planets filled with strange life forms.

---

## **Refined Drafts Using Prompt Techniques**

### **Prompt V2 — Query Decomposition**
Break the story into:

Setting

Main Character

Conflict

Resolution

### **Output V2**
Setting: A future Earth with advanced space travel.

Main Character: Captain Lyra, a 27-year-old explorer.

Conflict: A wormhole opens near Jupiter and threatens to destabilize the solar system.

Resolution: Lyra pilots a stabilizer probe into the wormhole, preventing collapse.


---

### **Prompt V3 — Decision-Making Prompt**
Choose one storyline:
A) Time Travel
B) Alien Civilization
C) Post-Apocalyptic Earth

### **Output V3**
Selected: B) Alien Civilization

Lyra encounters an ancient civilization living inside the wormhole, who reveal the secret of its instability.

---

### **Prompt V4 — Semantic Filter**
Rewrite the story in a cinematic, emotionally intense tone.

### **Output V4**

The wormhole shimmered like a wounded star as Lyra’s ship broke through its surface.
Inside, she found a dying civilization whose only hope lay in her hands.


---

### **Prompt V5 — Tail Generation**
Extend the story by adding a final twist ending.

### **Output V5 (Final Sci-Fi Story)**
As Lyra activated the stabilizer, the alien leader revealed the truth:
The wormhole was not a natural phenomenon—it was a message.
A doorway built by future humans calling for help across time.
